This blog is an example of learning to incorporate libraries, as well as practicing jQuery, SQL and JavaScript. It uses page.js, highlights.js, html5sql.js, handlebars.js, and the jQuery library.

Use Notes:
0. To create an article with html, standard text, and json file formats, please click the main header on the main index.html or "/home" route. Alternatively, you can follow the "/secret.html" route as well.
1. you can find the secret stats page by following the "/stats.html" route.
2. To see the SQL table, please use you console


Other Notes:
0. while using locally stored databases is not a practical model for professional use, it was intended in this context as a way to utilize SQL, without having to create our own database. Though, this feature will likely be added as I go at some point in the future
